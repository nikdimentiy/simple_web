## The Hustle Vision 🔥

**California Hustler's Weight Journey** is more than just a weight tracker - it's a lifestyle. Built with the California hustle mindset, this sleek web application helps you visualize and track your weight loss journey with style. No accounts, no servers, just you and your goals.

## What Makes This Different ⚡

Most weight trackers are clinical and uninspiring. This application brings the energy and motivation of the California lifestyle to your fitness journey:

- **Bold, Energetic Design**: Vibrant colors and motivational quotes keep you inspired
- **Progress-Focused**: Visual indicators show exactly how far you've come and what's left to achieve
- **Completely Private**: All data stays on your device - no servers, no sharing, no accounts
- **California Hustle Aesthetic**: Designed to motivate rather than just track numbers

## Core Features 🌟

- **Dynamic Progress Tracking**: Watch your progress bar fill up as you approach your target
- **Comprehensive Metrics Dashboard**: Current weight, goal weight, remaining pounds, and progress percentage
- **Complete Weight History**: See your journey with color-coded weight changes (green for loss, red for gain)
- **Data Import/Export**: Back up your journey or transfer between devices with simple JSON export
- **Responsive Design**: Hustle on any device - desktop, tablet, or mobile

## How To Use It 📱

1. **Set Your Goal**: The default goal is 173 lbs starting from 194 lbs
2. **Log Your Weight**: Click "Log Weight" to record your current weight
3. **Stay Consistent**: Add new entries regularly to see your progress
4. **Stay Motivated**: Watch your progress metrics update in real-time
5. **Export Regularly**: Keep your data safe by exporting JSON backups
